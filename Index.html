                Hi

                Alex Morgan became the youngest member of the U.S. women's national soccer team in 2009,
                 and was the first overall pick in the 2011 Women's Professional Soccer draft. At the 2012 
                 Summer Olympic Games, Morgan earned her first Olympic gold medal by helping the U.S. women 
                 defeat Japan. She overcame an injury to help the Americans win the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup,
                  and four years later she tied for the tournament high with six goals to help the U.S. claim its
                   second straight World Cup crown. Alexandra Patricia Morgan was born on July 2, 1989, in San Dimas,
                    California. Although she was a multisport athlete growing up, Morgan didn't start playing organized 
                    soccer until she was 14 years old. She attended Diamond Bar High School, where she was a three-time
                     all-league pick and was named an NSCAA All-American. After high school, Morgan went to the University
                      of California at Berkeley, where she led the Golden Bears to the NCAA Tournament in each of her four years
                       (and to the second round twice). In 2008, she helped the United States get to the championship of the FIFA
                        U-20 Women’s World Cup, scoring the winning goal in the final against North Korea — named the Goal of the
                         Tournament and second-best Goal of the Year by FIFA.
